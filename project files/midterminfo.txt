Group 5 - Suburban Outfitters
Midterm Project Submission
General Info.

This is our initial html/css/bootstrap submission for the Suburban Outfitters e-commerce site. There is still a lot
of work that needs to be done to polish the user experience, especially for an admin.

Use cases not started:
#7. Create Account, "custacct" page:
    -Customer
    -Admin
#9. View Order Details, "orderdetails" page:
    -Page for customer to see specific order details and status after they login to their account page
NEW Report Functionality:
    -Per Prof. Oh notes, still need to add admin reporting pages
    -Will have by final submission

Notes on existing pages:
#1. Home Page:
    -Links to specific filtered categories will eventually work
    -Currently only going to general all products list
#2. Products Page:
    -Filtering to category only items will eventually work, now only list all products
    -Eventually will link to a specific product page instead of just Red T-shirt
#5. Login:
    -Eventually logic with php/js will read domains ("@suburbanoutfitters.com" vs anything else) and direct accordingly
    -To ensure page linkage, currently have temporary links provided to get to the different admin/customer view
#14. Update Product Details and Inventory:
    -For new product, all fields will be blank
    -For existing product, fields will populate with existing info
    -Still missing "add new line" functionality to add inventory according to how many sizes there are for that item
General Admin Pages:
    -Styling was focused on customer pages, still need updates to applying CSS branding and more polish to final project
